# Empirical correction factor to convert the ideal, depth-limited, daily Net Primary Production (NPP)
# into an ecologically realistic annual value.
# This factor (f_correction = 1/300) accounts for cumulative ecosystem-level limitations such as:
# - algal mortality and senescence,
# - autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration,
# - zooplankton grazing and trophic recycling,
# - seasonal light fluctuations and nutrient constraints.
# It effectively compresses the idealized productivity of a perfect summer day into a long-term average,
# making the model output consistent with observed annual NPP in mesotrophic lake systems.
